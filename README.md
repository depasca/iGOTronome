# 🎵 GOTronome - Metronome and Rhythm trainer


(Android version here: https://github.com/depasca/GOTronome)

A precision metronome designed for real musicians, rehearsals, and skill training — available on Android and iOS.

GOTronome is an ultra-responsive visual metronome built for band practice, silent rhythm training, and phrase looping.
It uses native audio engines (Oboe on Android, AudioUnit on iOS) for sample-accurate timing and a custom rendering loop for perfectly synchronized visuals.

🚀 Features
🎚️ 1. Designed for Band Practice

In loud rehearsals, traditional click tracks get lost.
GOTronome gives you big, bright, color-changing beats that the whole group can see at a glance.

Every beat flashes with a clear visual pulse

First beat is highlighted

Works from across the room — perfect for live band sessions

Also great for drummers who want visual timing cues

🤫 2. Silent Bar Mode — Train Your Internal Clock

Can you keep the tempo when the metronome drops out?

Silent Bar Mode lets you mute a chosen number of bars so you can test and improve your internal timing:

Choose how many bars go completely silent

Dramatically improves timing accuracy and feel

Perfect for:

Rhythm training

Practicing steadiness without depending on clicks

🔁 3. Bar Loop Mode — Practice Phrases & Solos

Need to clean up a tricky lick or a short solo section?

Bar Loop Mode shows both the beat number and the current bar so you always know where you are in a phrase.
